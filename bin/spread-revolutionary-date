=head1 USAGE

  # Just execute the script in your shell
  # to spread current date to configured accounts on Twitter, Mastodon and Freenode:
  $ spread-revolutionary-date

  # Or, since this script do nothing but calling the L<App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate> Perl module,
  # use this one-liner:
  $ perl -MApp::SpreadRevolutionaryDate -e 'App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate->new->spread;'

  # Test spreading to Mastodon only:
  $ spread-revolutionary-date --targets=mastodon --test

  # Test spreading to Twitter only in English:
  $ spread-revolutionary-date --targets=twitter --test --locale=en

  # Spread to Twitter and Freenode explicit channels
  $ spread-revolutionary-date --targets=twitter \
      --targets=freenode \
      --freenode-channels='#revolution' \
      --freenode-channels='#acab'

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<spread-revolutionary-date> is a L<Free Software|https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html> that spreads the current date, expressed in L<French Revolutionary calendar|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_calendar>, to various social networks: L<Twitter|https://twitter.com/>, L<Mastodon|https://mastodon.social/>, and the L<Freenode|https://freenode.net/> Internet Relay Chat network. And you can easily extend these defaults targets with any desired one, see L</"EXTENDING TO NEW TARGETS">.


The French Revolutionary calendar, also called Republican calendar, was introduced during the L<French Revolution|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution>, and used from late 1793 to 1805, and also during the L<Paris Commune|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Commune> in 1871. This was an attempt to get rid of religious and royalist references found in Gregorian calendar when naming measures of Time. Months were given new names based on nature, each day of the year, instead of being named after an associated saint, had a unique name associated with the rural economy: agricultural tools, common animals, grains, pastures, trees, roots, flowers, fruits, plants, and minerals. But this was also an attempt to give more rational in measuring Time, basing measures on decimal system. Instead of weeks, each month was divided into exactly 3 I<dÃ©cades>, that is ten days; days were divided into ten hours; hours into 100 minutes; and minutes into 100 seconds.

You B<must> have a registered account on each of the targets you want to spread the revolutionary date. And you must get credentials for C<spread-revolutionary-date> to post on Twitter and Mastodon. Finally, you have to configure C<spread-revolutionary-date> to use these credentials, see L</CONFIGURATION> and L</"COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS"> below.

The revolutionary date and time is computed thanks to the L<DateTime::Calendar::FrenchRevolutionary> Perl module, by Jean Forget.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

Once again: you B<have to> configure C<spread-revolutionary-date> with credentials for registered account on each of the desired targets, so it can spread the revolutionary date on behalf of these accounts.

Configuration options may also be specified as command line parameters, see L</"COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS"> below, which take precedence on options of the configuration file.

The configuration file should lie on C<~/.config/spread-revolutionary-date/spread-revolutionary-date.conf> or C<~/.spread-revolutionary-date.conf>. In case a file is found on both paths, the second one is ignored. The configuration file should use the popular L<INI file format|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file>. A sample configuration file can be found in this distribution at C<etc/sample-spread-revolutionary-date.conf>.

=head2 General options

These options should appear outside of any section of the configuration file.

=head3 targets

This option can be specified multiple time. It explicitly defines targets where the revolutionary date should be spread to. Any value set for this option should be a valid target: any of the three default targets (C<twitter>, C<mastodon>, or C<freenode>) or some new target if you have extended this application (see L</"EXTENDING TO NEW TARGETS">). If this option is not defined, the revolutionary date is spread on all of three default targets: C<twitter>, C<mastodon>, and C<freenode>.

=head3 locale

Spread with chosen language. As of L<DateTime::Calendar::FrenchRevolutionary> 0.14, locale is limited to 'en' or 'fr', defaults to 'fr'.

=head3 test

Do no not actually spread the revolutionary date, just print it on standard output for Twitter and Mastodon, and send it on configured test channels for Freenode (see L</"test_channels"> below).

=head3 acab

Instead of spreading the current date and time, pretend that decimal time is 1:31:20 (which corresponds to 03:08:56 UTC, 04:08:56 Paris winter time, or 05:08:56 Paris summer time, in sexagesimal scale used by common Anglo-Babylonian Time).

=head3 twitter I<DEPRECATED>

This option is I<deprecated> since version 0.07 of this distribution and may be removed in future release. Please use L</targets> option below. Spread on Twitter explicitly. If none of the C<twitter>, C<mastodon>, C<freenode> option is set, the revolutionary date is spread on all of these three targets.

=head3 mastodon I<DEPRECATED>

This option is I<deprecated> since version 0.07 of this distribution and may be removed in future release. Please use L</targets> option below. Spread on Mastodon explicitly. If none of the C<twitter>, C<mastodon>, C<freenode> option is set, the revolutionary date is spread on all of these three targets.

=head3 freenode I<DEPRECATED>

This option is I<deprecated> since version 0.07 of this distribution and may be removed in future release. Please use L</targets> option below. Spread on Freenode explicitly. If none of the C<twitter>, C<mastodon>, C<freenode> option is set, the revolutionary date is spread on all of these three targets.

=head2 Twitter options

=head3 nickname

Your Freenode nickname.

=head3 password

Your Freenode password.

=head3 channels

This option can be specified multiple time. C<spread-revolutionary-date> will spread on every channel specified with this option. This option should be specified at least one time if L</test> option is not set. It is ignored if L</test> option is set.

=head3 test_channels

=head1 EXTENDING TO NEW TARGETS

Version 0.07 of this distribution is a complete redesign of the API, taking advantage of L<Moose>, the postmodern object system for Perl 5, allowing to easily extend C<spread-revolutionary-date> to other targets than the default ones (C<Twitter>, C<Mastondon> and C<Freenode>.

To add a new target, you should write a new class in the C<App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::Target::> namespace (that is: the class should be C<App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::Target::Mytarget> for a new C<Mytarget> target), that consumes the L<App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::Target> role. See L<App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::Target/DESCRIPTION> for a comprehensive description of this role.

Such a target class is actually just a wrapper. Usually a target has to use an existing specific module (which can be a C<Moose> class or not) to perform the actual work of posting a message according the specific target protocol, after having complied with any potential required authentication. Such authentication and posting should be carried on by the constructor or the required C<spread> method of the target class.

To perform authentication and to post a message, there is a strong likelihood that the new target requires specific parameters (for eg. tokens, keys, account name, password, channels, etc.). These parameters should be defined as required attributes of the target class. Values for such attributes should be set in the L<configuration file|/CONFIGURATION>, inside a section named after the target (C<[mytarget]>), or as L<command line parameters|/"COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS"> prefixed with the name of the target followed by a dash (C<--mytarget-myparam>).

Should you extend C<spread-revolutionary-date> to a new target, we advise you to have a look on how default targets are implemented: L<App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::Target::Twitter> with L<Net::Twitter::Lite::WithAPIv1_1> C<worker>, L<App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::Target::Mastodon> with L<Mastodon::Client> C<worker>. Both are using L<OAuth2 protocol|https://oauth.net/2/> to perform authentication. The third default target, C<App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::Target::Freenode>, uses a L<chatbot|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot>: L<App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::Target::Freenode::Bot> subclassing L<Bot::BasicBot>. You can also see a very simple example with a test file provided in this distribution at C<t/new_target.t>, which just prints out the revolutionary date on the standard output using core module L<IO::Handle>.
