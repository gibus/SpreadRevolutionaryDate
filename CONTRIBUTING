Wow, you want to help?  That's great!
 
If you want to help:
 
  * Don't break the public interface.  You can add to it, but don't
    break code that already depends on this interface.
  * I'll take bug reports however you want to send them (RT, Github
    issue, email, etc).
  * I'll take code changes however you want to send them, but prefer
    it via Github pull request.
  * If you make suggestions/changes, I'll credit you unless you ask
    specifically otherwise.  I'll use your email and PAUSE ID (if
    applicable) if I can find it.  If I get this wrong or you change
    either, just jot me a note or PR to change it.
 
Some things you can do that would make me smile:
 
  * Obviously, you can extend this distribution by adding some new
    targets to spread to, or new ways to craft the message to be spread,
    see README to know how to do this.
  * Feel free to look at the TODO file - I've pointed out some things I
    want to do with the module.  Feel free to do any of them (but if it
    is a bigger item, you might jot me a note first so that I don't
    accidentally duplicate your effort!)
  * Write tests for things that are known to be broken (UTF-8 file
    handling, for instance).  Mark those as "todo" tests so that the
    failures do not cause test failures.
  * Improvements to documentation are always appreciated
  * If the module is missing something you would find useful, or you're
    confused about something, or if it doesn't seem to work the way you
    want, email me or open a Github issue.  The module makes sense to me
    and my way of working, but if it doesn't to you, you probably are
    not the only person who it doesn't make sense to.
  * "Meta" stuff is great too - I'm no expert on Dist::Zilla and all
    that it can/should do.  So please feel free to send me suggestions
    or PR for packaging, metafiles, etc
