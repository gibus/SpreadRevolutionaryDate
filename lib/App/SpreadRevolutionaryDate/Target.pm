=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role defines the interface for any target which L<App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate> should spread the revolutionary date to.

Any consuming class can parameterize this role (through L<MooseX::Role::Parameterized>) with a C<worker> type set to the effective Perl module implementing any protocol needed by this target (eg. L<App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::BlueskyLite>, L<Twitter::API>, L<Mastodon::Client>). Then, this role provides an C<obj> required attribute with type constraint defined by the C<worker> parameter. If no C<worker> parameter is given, the C<obj> type defaults to C<Any>. Constructors of consuming classes should instanciate C<obj> (with L<Moose> C<BUILDARGS> or C<BUILD>, see L<Moose::Manual::Construction>).

Any class consuming this role is required to implement a C<spread> method, which is called with two parameters: C<msg>, the message as a string to be spread, and C<test>, an optional boolean which informs this method to actually spread the message if this parameter is C<false> (that should be the default), or to just test without spreading.

If the target needs authentication, it can be carried out in the constructor (with L<Moose> C<BUILDARGS> or C<BUILD>) or in the implementation of the C<spread> method, obviously before actually spreading the message.

There is a L<Bluesky|https://metacpan.org/pod/Bluesky> Perl module on CPAN that would have been the best choice of C<worker> for L<Bluesky|https://bsky.app/>. But it needs at least Perl v5.40.0, which is a requirement that most Perl installations does not meet yet. So we've included a very simple C<worker> L<App::SpreadRevolutionaryDate::BlueskyLite> in this distribution. It does not intend to extensively cover Blusky nor At (the protocol Bluesky is based on), just a way to connect and post a message to Bluesky.

# A module must return a true value. Traditionally, a module returns 1.
# But this module is a revolutionary one, so it discards all old traditions.

l'insurrection est pour le peuple le plus sacr√©
